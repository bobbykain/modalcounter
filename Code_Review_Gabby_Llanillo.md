Project name: Modal Counter Point Network
Programmers: Bobby Kain and John Ligon
Code Reviewer: Gabby Llanillo

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 3 based on the following criteria:

1  The documentation is insufficient to enalbe me to compile the project, or at least one of the program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically: code is compiling but not really sure what it's supposed to do or where to go from here

4  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not produce the deliverables specified in the documentation for thei submission or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output, produces all of the specified deliverables, and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
Having instructions on which files to run and how everything is supposed to work would be helpful. 
The README files don't have much content to them besides background information on why the project was made.
Add information regarding the deliverables in the documentation and what has been done/is left to be done.
