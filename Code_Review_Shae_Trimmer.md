Project name: Modal Counter
Programmers: Bobby Kain and John Ligon
Code Reviewer: Shae Trimmer

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __3__ based on the following criteria:

1  The documentation is insufficient to enalbe me to compile the project, or at least one of the program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

3  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:  I was able to compile and run the code, yet could not achieve much with it.

4  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not produce the deliverables specified in the documentation for thei submission or is insufficiently documented.
Specifically:

5  The program produces correct output, produces all of the specified deliverables, and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
I checked the documentation (including the README files on github), but could not find the information on how the program actually works.  An updated README would be very helpful.
