Read Me for John

Much of my contribution on this project was actually obtaining the wav files as well as writing the writer and reader classes
whilst also helping on the Player class, however Bobby was the one who knew the most about playing wav files in java. Along with
this I made it possible to actually run this one the MTServer program. I helped in making the gui in its later stages as well
and wrote the Analysis class.
